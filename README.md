# Clean Django Blog
## Based on my final project for CS50W

This django blog is simple and responsive.

Requires python, django, pillow and django-filer(recommended).

Steps beforehand:
1. cmd: pip install python
2. cmd: pip install django
3. cmd: pip install Pillow
4. cmd: python manage.py makemigrations
5. cmd: python manage.py migrate
6. place a fallback.png image in blog/media (or change models.py accordingly)
7. cmd: python manage.py runserver
8. create first post in admin (you'll get an error loading the homepage before you do)
9. Done!
